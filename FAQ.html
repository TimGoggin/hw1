        <p id="faq1">Q: Can I buy this product? <br>

            A: No. This site was designed and published as part of the COMP 333 Software Engineering class at Wesleyan University. The described platform is not publicly
            
            available but rather is created as a training exercise. <br>
            
            
            
            Q: How does your product help artists? <br>
            
            A: Artists can gain exposure  for their songs by putting them out there to be reviewed! Artists keep all rights and profits associated with the music.</p>

        <p id = "faq2">Q: Why are so many features behind a paywall? <br>

            A: We are committed to creating a good user experience - so we keep the number of ads to a minimum. This means that we must charge in order to provide servers to upload songs.<br>
            
            
            
            Q: Will there be an annual payment option? <br>
            
            A: Coming soon!</p>
